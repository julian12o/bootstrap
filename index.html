        <h1>OsamaSon</h1>
        <p>​Amari Deshawn Middleton, known professionally as OsamaSon, is a 21-year-old rapper, songwriter, and record
            producer hailing from Goose Creek, South Carolina. Born on May 20, 2003, he began his musical journey in
            2020 under the moniker PradaUMari, later transitioning to OsamaSon in 2021. He gained prominence within the
            underground rap scene with tracks like "Cts-V" and "Troops" in early 2023. His debut studio album, Osama
            Season, was released in July 2023, followed by Flex Musix in December 2023, and Jump Out in January 2025,
            which charted at number 151 on the Billboard 200. OsamaSon is renowned for his experimental "maximalist
            rage" sound, characterized by heavy bass and synths, drawing comparisons to artists like Playboi Carti and
            Chief Keef. Despite challenges such as frequent music leaks, he continues to make significant strides in the

        <h3>His Influences </h3>
